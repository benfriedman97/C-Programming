# Josephus Implementation
Implements the Josephus problem using a circular linked list implementation. The Josephus problem is where there are N people arranged in a circle and every Mth person is removed until one person is remaining who is then chosen as the leader.

Explanation of output: the josephus function is run for M = 10 for N = 2 up to 1000. On the diagram, each asterisk represents 10 occurences and the range represents the position of the person. So, for example since 651 - 700 had two asterisks, that means there were at least 20 occurences of the last person being between the 651st and 700th person.
