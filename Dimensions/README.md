# Point and dimensions interface.
This program generates a random set of points in N dimensions within the N-dimensional unit square, cube etc. (i.e. 2 dimensions is a 1x1 square, 3 dimensions is a 1x1x1 cube, 4 dimensions is 1x1x1x1 etc.) and then calculates the number of points that are within a certain distance of eachother.

A point interface for N-dimensions was developed to implement the program.
