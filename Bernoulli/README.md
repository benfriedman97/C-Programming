Runs the bernoulli experiment for coin flips for a certain amount of trials, coin flips per trial, and the probability of getting heads (since it's from user input it doesn't have to be 0.5). Then, a primitive probability distribution is displayed. Each asterisk next to a number indicates that on a trial, the number of heads was that particular number
